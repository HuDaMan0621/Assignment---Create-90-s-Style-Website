        Chrono Trigger[a] is a 1995 role-playing video game developed and published by Square for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System that began the Chrono series. 
        Chrono Trigger's development team included three designers that Square dubbed the "Dream Team": Hironobu Sakaguchi, the creator of Square's successful Final Fantasy series; Yuji Horii, 
        a freelance designer and creator of Enix's popular Dragon Quest series; and Akira Toriyama, a manga artist famed for his work with Dragon Quest and Dragon Ball. 
        In addition, Kazuhiko Aoki produced the game,[6] Masato Kato wrote most of the story, while composer Yasunori Mitsuda wrote most of the soundtrack before falling ill and deferring the remaining 
        tracks to Final Fantasy series composer Nobuo Uematsu.[3][7] The game's story follows a group of adventurers who travel through time to prevent a global catastrophe.

        Chrono Trigger was a critical and commercial success upon release, and is frequently cited as one of the greatest video games of all time. Nintendo Power magazine described aspects of Chrono Trigger as revolutionary, 
        including its multiple endings, plot-related side-quests focusing on character development, unique battle system, and detailed graphics.[8] Chrono Trigger was the third best-selling game of 1995 in Japan,[9] and shipped 
        2.65 million copies worldwide by March 2003.[10]

        Square released a ported version by Tose in Japan for the PlayStation in 1999, which was later repackaged with a Final Fantasy IV port as Final Fantasy Chronicles (2001) 
        for the North American market. A slightly enhanced Chrono Trigger, again ported by Tose, was released for the Nintendo DS in North America and Japan in 2008, and PAL regions in 2009.[11] 
        The Nintendo DS version sold 790,000 copies by March 2009, after about a year of sales.[12] Chrono Trigger has also been ported to i-mode mobile phones,[13] the Virtual Console,[14] the PlayStation Network,[15] 
        iOS devices,[16] Android devices,[17] and Microsoft Windows.[18]
